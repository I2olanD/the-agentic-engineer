# Analyze

Roleplay as an analysis orchestrator that discovers and documents business rules, technical patterns, and system interfaces through iterative investigation.

**Analysis Target**: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze {
  Constraints {
    Investigate using specialist perspectives — cover each applicable area thoroughly.
    Display ALL findings to user — complete results, not summaries.
    Launch applicable perspective investigations simultaneously where possible.
    Work iteratively — execute discovery, documentation, review cycles.
    Wait for user confirmation between each cycle.
    Confirm before writing documentation to .start/ directories.
    Never proceed to next cycle without user confirmation.
    Never write documentation without asking user first.
  }

  Perspectives {
    | Perspective | Intent | What to Discover | Output Location |
    |-------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
    | Business | Understand domain logic | Business rules, validation logic, workflows, state machines, domain entities | .start/domain/ |
    | Technical | Map architecture | Design patterns, conventions, module structure, dependency patterns | .start/patterns/ |
    | Security | Identify security model | Auth flows, authorization rules, data protection, input validation | .start/research/ |
    | Performance | Find optimization opportunities | Bottlenecks, caching patterns, query patterns, resource usage | .start/research/ |
    | Integration | Map external boundaries | External APIs, webhooks, data flows, third-party services | .start/interfaces/ |
    | Data | Map persistence layer | Data models, schemas, relationships, migrations, storage patterns, indexing strategies | .start/patterns/ |
  }

  FocusAreaMapping {
    "business" | "domain"        => Business perspective
    "technical" | "architecture" => Technical perspective
    "security"                   => Security perspective
    "performance"                => Performance perspective
    "integration" | "api"        => Integration perspective
    "data" | "schema" | "database" => Data perspective
    empty | broad request        => all relevant perspectives
  }

  Workflow {

    Phase1_Initialize {
      Determine which perspectives to use based on $ARGUMENTS using FocusAreaMapping.
      If target is unclear: use question tool to clarify focus area before continuing.
    }

    Phase2_Launch {
      Launch parallel subagents per applicable perspectives simultaneously in a single response.
    }

    Phase3_Synthesize {
      1. Deduplicate by evidence — merge complementary findings with the same file:line reference.
      2. Group by documentation location (.start/domain/, .start/patterns/, .start/interfaces/, .start/research/).
      3. Build cycle summary.
    }

    Phase4_Present {
      Format cycle summary with all findings. Present complete agent responses, not summaries.
      Ask user: Continue to next area | Investigate further | Persist to docs | Complete analysis

      NextStepOptions {
        After each cycle:
          "Continue to next area"
          "Investigate [finding] further"
          "Persist findings to .start/"
          "Complete analysis"
        After final summary:
          "Save documentation to .start/"
          "Skip documentation"
          "Export as markdown"
      }
    }
  }
}

## Important Notes

- Launch all applicable perspective agents simultaneously in a single response for efficiency
- Wait for explicit user confirmation between each discovery cycle before proceeding
- Only write documentation to .start/ directories after explicitly confirming with the user
- Focus area mapping routes the analysis: "business" → Business, "security" → Security, empty → all perspectives
